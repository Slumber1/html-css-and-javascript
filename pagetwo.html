    <p>essay, an analytic, interpretative, or critical literary composition
usually much shorter and less systematic and formal than a dissertation or
thesis and usually dealing with its subject from a limited and often personal
point of view
<p><em>Some early treatises—such as those of Cicero on the pleasantness of
old age or on the art of “divination,” Seneca on anger or clemency, and
Plutarch on the passing of oracles—presage to a certain degree the form
and tone of the essay</em></p>
